# spoiler-art

Your images need to be either .jpg or .png and they need to be in the same folder as spoiler-generator.py.
If your image doesnt look properly then you may have to play around with the minimal brightness.
Works best with simple images like emojis, doesnt work well if your image has a bright background.

# requirements
* Python 3.x
* Pillow library, install with pip using `pip install Pillow` https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
